Update of meowmeows mod
https://ludeon.com/forums/index.php?topic=39262.0

- Added smoke to the drill when drilling
- Added Send up-button to the underground drill
- Added Russian translation, thanks WolF8RocK
- Added mod-settings for changing the size of the generated map-layers
- Added mod-setting for low-tech mode where the drill is operated manually and don't require power
- Added option for transfering items between layers automatically if they are in nearby built storages. You need storage-buildings built both on the top level as well as on a lower level, next to the shaft. You will then get an added option on the shaft to automatically transfer items between them. 
- Added power-transfer from the top layer to the lower layers. A set amount of power is split equally to each layer.
- sk4p3g04t made retexture for this mod: [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2965262893]DeepRim Retexture[/url]
- Holding CTRL while transferring pawns/items will now also switch the map to the targeted map
- New icon textures made by Ontheheavens
- New drill texture made by Ontheheavens based on the the retexture mod by sk4p3g04t. The old texture will be used when selecting the "Low-tech"-option in the mod-settings.
- Manual drilling should now only be possible when the "Low-tech" option is on, as the new modern texture does not really allow manual drilling.
- For a more medieval look of the low tech drill, take a look at [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3320967700]Van's Retexture : DeepRim[/url] by Sir Van
- If you want all you power distributed freely between your layers instead of the set amount defined in the lifts you can use [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=2934265284]Cross Dimensional Power 2[/url] by Vex

Will now generate versions of cave biomes in [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2969748433]Biomes! Caverns[/url]  (Thanks to m00nl1ght-dev for the fix) and [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2259124387]CaveBiome[/url] if loaded.

[b]The 1.5 update brings a lot of new features and QoL additions, all done by SunPraise[/b]
- Layers can now be renamed
- Abandoned layer depth will not be reused
- Items can be transfered between layers and not just via the surface
- Ore density of the underground layers can be adjusted
- More flexibility with the power-transfer between layers

Allows construction of mining shaft, which can drill down and bring you new maps to explore and mine for resource.  
Never run out of ores! 
Avoid the lazy Deep drill with this new revolutionary mining method!

- Start by building a mining shaft and click start. It requires power while drilling. (It's not magic, duh)
- Once finished, you get the option to send people and item down
- They'll end up in the underground map, full of rocks and ores to mine.

FAQ:
Will there be raids in the underground?
Unlikely. I can't say for sure. Raids can probably still be forced for underground, but it'll probably just spew some red errors. Can't say what will happen, since there's quite a number of storyteller, and some are custom.

Will this mod works with [X]?
Most likely. If there's any incompatibility issue, please tell me.

Will [Custom Ore of some mod] spawn underground?
If it spawns above ground, it will likely spawn underground (Assuming that the mod configured them correctly, instead of writing a code to spawn spawn ore after your pawns landed) . At the moment, it is confirmed that hardcore SK's ores spawn correctly underground.

LAG! LAG! LAG! It's lagging!
That's not a question. But yes, this mod will take more CPU when drilling a new layer, specifically, when the drilling is done, and a new layer is generated. It only last a moment though, after that, you should be fine. There's no solution for this at the moment, unless Rimworld somehow does multi-threading. Having too many layer will also cause lag. Try to avoid that.

How do I move item from one layer to another?
Put a stockpile zone on the lift, move whatever item you wish to move. Use the bring up/move down feature to move the items. (Items, pawns, and animals are all moved by the lift in the same way)

Planned Feature:
Multiple shaft to single map, allowing tunnels to be made
Balancing
Deeper layers will have different map generation method. For example, lava and hotter in deeper layer.

Author/Mod Team
Me. Just me. I think, for now.
Oh, wait. Asset by jabbamonkey is used.
